                In college, I began my journey by delving into <span class="neon">C++</span> and 
                <span class="neon">Assembly</span> language, which provided 
                me with a deeper understanding of low-level programming. Over the years, I expanded 
                my skill set to include <span class="neon">Python</span>, particularly after developing a 
                'smart' Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation for the board game Go (Gomoku).

                I'm currently sharpening my skills in <span class="neon">HTML/CSS</span> and 
                <span class="neon">JavaScript</span> through a personal project.
                The website you are looking at is the result of this passion.

                to new colleagues, and meticulously monitoring pricing, product quality, and inventory levels. 
                Moreover, I serve as one of the <span class="neon">keyholders</span>, assuming responsibility for the entire store

                          Develop a Sailfish OS port for the Fairphone 4, a task that has not been undertaken previously. Our project group, 
                          consisting of four other members, was assigned the seamless integration of Sailfish OS on the Fairphone 4, encompassing all 
                          essential functions. An added opportunity presented itself: the ability to contribute our progress to the dedicated open-source 
                          communities supporting both Fairphone and Sailfish OS.

                          After an intensive five-month development phase, we successfully implemented all essential smartphone 
                          functionalities in our custom ROM. We packaged the solution into an accessible image and created a 
                          comprehensive installation guide, which was shared on GitHub.
                          <br><br>
                          We concluded the project by sharing our progress through posts on forums like XDA and Faiphone in order to 
                          fulfill our commitment to the open-source community; making a valuable contribution to collective knowledge and advancements.
