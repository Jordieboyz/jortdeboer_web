        shortDescription: 'A low-level recreation of Space Invaders built entirely from scratch. No OS, no libraries. Features a custom bootloader, graphics driver, and input handling, all written in assembly and C to run directly on hardware.',
        longDescription: 'This was my deepest dive into hardware interaction. I wrote a **custom bootloader** to initialize the hardware (a modified ARM platform), then implemented a **VGA graphics driver** directly manipulating memory registers to render sprites. The input handling was based on direct polling of GPIO pins. The complexity lay in optimizing the C and Assembly routines to ensure a smooth 60 FPS frame rate without any OS-level scheduling or memory protection. This project solidified my understanding of the hardware-software boundary and tight optimization loops, making it the most technically rigorous project on my portfolio.',
